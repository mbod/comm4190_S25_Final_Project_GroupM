    "# Exploring Existing LLM's Biotech Stock Analysis Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to prepare for the development of our BioEquity Insight system, we conducted initial testing with existing LLMs to evaluate how effectively they analyze biotech stocks. This exploration helped us identify gaps in current AI capabilities and informed the design of our specialized biotech investment assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ChatGPT-4\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt:\n",
    "How has Moderna's stock (MRNA) performed since their COVID vaccine approval?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response:\n",
    "Moderna's stock (MRNA) has experienced significant volatility since the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine on December 18, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the period immediately following approval, MRNA saw substantial gains, rising from around $140 per share in December 2020 to a peak of approximately $484 in August 2021, representing over a 245% increase. This surge was primarily driven by the successful rollout of their vaccine and strong revenue growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since that peak, the stock has experienced a considerable pullback. By early 2022, concerns about diminishing vaccine demand, increased competition, and questions about the company's post-pandemic product pipeline led to a significant correction. Currently, MRNA trades at much lower levels than its 2021 peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key factors affecting the stock since approval include:\n",
    "- Strong initial revenue growth from vaccine sales\n",
    "- Subsequent concerns about declining vaccine demand as the pandemic evolved\n",
    "- Pipeline development for other mRNA-based treatments\n",
    "- Competition from other vaccine manufacturers\n",
    "- Broader market sentiment toward biotech stocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the recent pullback, investors who purchased MRNA at the time of vaccine approval and held through today would still have realized gains, though not at the level seen during the 2021 peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \n",
    "The response is comprehensive but lacks specific current price data or detailed performance metrics. It doesn't mention exact percentage returns or compare performance to biotech indices or competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt:\n",
    "Compare Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Regeneron (REGN) in the rare disease space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response:\n",
    "# Comparison: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) vs. Regeneron (REGN)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Market Position\n",
    "- **Vertex**: Leading player in cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment with near-monopoly status; expanding into other rare diseases\n",
    "- **Regeneron**: More diversified, with strengths in eye diseases (Eylea), inflammatory conditions (Dupixent), and rare diseases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Revenue Sources\n",
    "- **Vertex**: Heavily dependent on CF franchise (Trikafta/Kaftrio, Symdeko, Orkambi, Kalydeco)\n",
    "- **Regeneron**: More diversified revenue streams across multiple therapeutic areas\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Strength\n",
    "- **Vertex**: Strong pipeline in CF, pain management, Type 1 diabetes, and APOL1-mediated kidney disease\n",
    "- **Regeneron**: Broad pipeline with multiple late-stage candidates across immunology, oncology, and rare genetic diseases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Financial Performance\n",
    "- **Vertex**: Strong consistent growth driven by CF market dominance\n",
    "- **Regeneron**: Solid growth with less dependence on any single product\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recent Catalysts\n",
    "- **Vertex**: Positive data from Type 1 diabetes and pain management programs\n",
    "- **Regeneron**: Continued Dupixent label expansions and emerging oncology portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "Both companies maintain strong balance sheets with minimal debt and substantial cash reserves, positioning them well for continued R&D investment and potential acquisitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "The response provides a good overview but doesn't include quantitative financial metrics, stock performance comparisons, or specific pricing data. It's missing concrete numbers that investors would need for decision-making."

    "How did the FDA approval for BIIB's Alzheimer's drug affect their stock price?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response:\n",
    "Biogen's stock price experienced significant volatility following the FDA approval of its Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm (aducanumab) on June 7, 2021:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immediate Impact:**\n",
    "- On the approval day, BIIB shares surged approximately 38%, closing at $395.85\n",
    "- This represented the stock's biggest one-day gain since 2004\n",
    "- Market capitalization increased by about $17 billion in a single day\n",

    "**Medium-Term Performance:**\n",
    "- Within a month after approval, the stock reached a peak of $414.71 on June 10, 2021\n",
    "- By August 2021, concerns about narrow prescription guidelines, Medicare coverage limitations, and controversial approval process led to significant pullback\n",
    "- Six months post-approval, the stock had surrendered most gains, trading near pre-approval levels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long-Term Impact:**\n",
    "- Biogen eventually announced a significant price cut (about 50%) for Aduhelm in December 2021 due to slow adoption\n",
    "- In April 2022, CMS restricted Medicare coverage, severely limiting the drug's commercial potential\n",
    "- One year after approval, BIIB stock traded significantly below pre-approval levels\n",
    "\n",
    "This FDA approval demonstrates how regulatory decisions can create both immediate price surges and subsequent corrections based on commercial realities in the biotech sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "This response provides specific dates, price points, and percentage changes, giving a much clearer picture of how the FDA approval affected the stock. This level of specific data and analysis is what we're aiming for with BioEquity Insight.\n",

    "Note:\n",
    "This combined approach delivered significantly more detailed analysis with current financial metrics, growth rates, and pipeline developments. The integration of real-time financial data with AI analysis produces the comprehensive insights we aim to provide with BioEquity Insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions from Our Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Our testing revealed several key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generalist LLMs provide variable quality analysis** - While they can offer basic information about biotech stocks, they often lack detailed financial metrics, current data, or sector-specific context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Technical analysis is often superficial** - Most LLMs provide generic technical indicators without visualization or actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Specialized data + LLM analysis is superior** - Combining financial APIs with AI analysis produces the most valuable insights for investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Biotech-specific context is lacking** - Standard LLMs often miss the nuances of regulatory impacts, clinical trial results, and pipeline valuations critical to biotech investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization capabilities are essential** - None of the tested solutions provided effective data visualization, which is critical for understanding biotech stock trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings have directly informed our development of BioEquity Insight, which addresses these gaps through specialized biotech prompting, integrated real-time financial data, customized visualization, and deep analysis of sector-specific catalysts.\n"
