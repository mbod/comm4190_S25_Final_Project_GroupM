    "# Project Evaluation: BioEquity Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API Dependencies and Rate Limits**: We encountered issues with Google Custom Search API rate limits, causing intermittent failures when analyzing multiple companies in succession. This significantly impacts the reliability of the catalyst identification component.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inconsistent Chart Generation**: The LLM-generated visualization code sometimes fails to produce appropriate charts, especially for complex queries or when comparing multiple biotech stocks with different market caps. The fallback chart doesn't always present the most relevant metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Runtime Performance**: Significant latency occurs when processing multiple tickers simultaneously due to the sequential API calls to Yahoo Finance, Google Search, and OpenAI. Analysis of comparative stocks can take 20+ seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited Biotech Context**: While we intended to provide specialized biotech analysis, the o3-mini model sometimes misses important biotech-specific nuances like the significance of clinical trial phases or regulatory pathways.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timezone Issues**: We encountered persistent problems with timestamp handling in historical data, requiring multiple tz_localize(None) calls throughout the codebase to ensure compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Propagation**: When one component fails (like Google Search or chart generation), it sometimes impacts the quality of the entire analysis rather than gracefully degrading.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specialized Domain Focus**: The project successfully delivers on its core promise of biotech-specific stock analysis, connecting financial metrics with industry catalysts like FDA approvals and clinical trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Stock Comparison**: The system effectively handles comparative analysis between multiple biotech companies, providing normalized charts and side-by-side metric comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Visualization**: Rather than generic stock charts, the visualization adapts based on the specific user query, highlighting relevant metrics whether the question focuses on dividends, technical indicators, or price movement around catalysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integration of Multiple Data Sources**: The combination of Yahoo Finance data with Google Custom Search results creates a more comprehensive analysis than either source alone could provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexible Natural Language Processing**: The ticker extraction component successfully handles various ways users might refer to biotech companies (by name or symbol).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interactive Plotly Charts**: The generated visualizations are fully interactive, allowing users to zoom, pan, and hover for more detailed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robust Error Handling**: The system includes graceful fallbacks at multiple levels, ensuring users receive at least basic analysis even when components fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Endeavors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integration with Clinical Trial Databases**: Connect directly to ClinicalTrials.gov and FDA databases for more reliable and comprehensive catalyst tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Fine-tuning**: Train a specialized model on biotech financial reports and clinical documents to improve domain-specific understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implement Caching**: Add a caching layer to reduce API calls and improve performance for frequently analyzed stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhance Pipeline Visualization**: Create dedicated visualization types for drug development pipelines and milestone timelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Competitor Analysis**: Automatically identify and compare companies working in similar therapeutic areas or targeting the same indications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Develop Screening Tools**: Allow users to filter the biotech universe based on criteria like pipeline strength, cash runway, or therapeutic focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deploy as Standalone Application**: Package the tool as a desktop or mobile application for improved performance and reduced dependency on web infrastructure."
