# COMM4190 Final Project - BioEquity Insight

## An AI-Powered Stock Analysis Assistant for Biotechnology Investments

**By Group M** - Vidur Saigal

## Introduction

Throughout this semester, we've explored the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) across various applications. Our journey has culminated in developing BioEquity Insight - an AI-powered stock analysis assistant specifically designed for biotechnology investments.

The biotechnology sector represents one of the most dynamic yet challenging areas for investors. It's characterized by complex scientific developments, regulatory hurdles, and binary events that can dramatically impact stock prices overnight. Our tool bridges the knowledge gap for investors by providing comprehensive analysis, visualization, and insights tailored to the unique nature of biotech stocks.

## BioEquity Insight: Value Proposition

### Background

The biotechnology investment landscape presents unique challenges compared to other sectors. Investors must interpret clinical trial data, understand regulatory pathways, and assess scientific innovations without necessarily having extensive scientific expertise. Traditional stock analysis tools often fall short in providing the specialized context needed for biotech investing decisions.

While platforms like Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg provide general market data, they rarely offer biotech-specific insights such as clinical trial progress, regulatory milestone tracking, or patent expiration implications. The rise of AI capabilities has opened new possibilities for sector-specific investment analysis that integrates multiple data sources and domain knowledge.

BioEquity Insight addresses this gap by combining real-time financial data with biotech-specific catalysts, providing intuitive visualizations, and leveraging AI to translate complex scientific developments into actionable investment insights.

### Key Features

- **Biotech-Focused Stock Analysis**: Specialized prompting and data collection focused on metrics most relevant to biotechnology companies
- **Catalyst Tracking**: Automated identification and analysis of key biotech catalysts including FDA decisions, clinical trial results, and patent developments
- **Multi-Stock Comparison**: Side-by-side analysis of multiple biotech stocks to identify sector trends and comparative advantages
- **Dynamic Visualization**: AI-generated charts that highlight the metrics most relevant to each specific user query
- **Plain-Language Insights**: Complex biotech developments explained in accessible terms for investors of all expertise levels

## Technology Stack

BioEquity Insight leverages several powerful technologies:

- **Financial Data**: Real-time and historical stock information via Yahoo Finance API
- **News & Catalysts**: Custom Google Search integration for recent biotech-specific news
- **Natural Language Processing**: OpenAI's language models for query interpretation and analysis
- **Interactive Visualization**: Custom Plotly charts generated based on specific user questions
- **LangChain Framework**: For orchestrating the AI components and managing prompt workflows

## How It Works

1. **Query Processing**: The system extracts stock tickers from natural language user queries
2. **Data Collection**: Comprehensive financial information is gathered for each ticker
3. **Catalyst Research**: Recent news and events are collected for relevant biotech companies
4. **AI Analysis**: The system generates insights by analyzing both financial data and recent catalysts
5. **Visualization**: Custom charts are created to illustrate key points relevant to the user's query
6. **Results Presentation**: Analysis and visualizations are presented alongside source information

## Use Cases

- **Pipeline Analysis**: Evaluate a biotech company's drug development pipeline and milestone timeline
- **Regulatory Impact Assessment**: Analyze how FDA decisions have historically affected similar stocks
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare multiple biotech companies within specific therapeutic areas
- **Catalyst Prediction**: Identify upcoming events likely to impact biotech stock performance
- **Technical Analysis**: Visualize biotech-specific technical indicators and trading patterns

## Future Development

- Integration with clinical trial databases for real-time trial updates
- Patent expiration tracking and impact analysis
- Biotech-specific sentiment analysis from scientific publications
- Enhanced visualization of drug pipeline progress
- Integration with genomic databases for scientific breakthrough assessment

An AI Investing Advisor for College Students by Emmy Keogh and Kendall Allen
Introduction
Over the course of this semester, we have had the amazing opportunity to explore, test, and learn about dozens of different Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our understanding of this rapidly changing field has grown exponentially by engaging with various interfaces and prompting styles. From creating health campaigns to interacting with mock tutors, our experience has prepared us to take on this final project: designing our own AI agent. Despite the market’s saturation, we have found a gap in the supply for which there is ample demand and are excited about the opportunity for growth it presents. Therefore, we are proud to present CollegiateCapital, an AI advisor focused on assisting college/university students with investing in the stock market.

Outlining the Agent’s Value Proposition
Background
In an economic landscape that allows even the smallest fish in the sea to make big waves, there is currently a massive market for online platforms that inform users about the stock market, advise on buy/sell behavior, manage portfolios, and facilitate trades. For nearly the past decade, apps like Robinhood and Alinea Invest have allowed users to engage with the market on a smaller, individual scale while leveraging modern technology to provide advanced insights. The latter platform focuses specifically on women clientele, while both of them promote themselves specifically to younger demographics. It was not until much more recently, though, that these kinds of programs began to harness the power of AI.

Many legacy forums for trading like Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ have begun to bring AI capabilities into their data collection. Because their integrations are often “AI-powered” rather than functioning as interactive assistants, though, newer companies have entered the fold to fill in missing niches. Called the “Lovechild of ChatGPT and Robinhood,” AI portfolio mentor Magnifi is one of the first investing platforms that uses ChatGPT and computer programs to provide personalized, data-driven investment advice. We were inspired to iterate on this progressing combination of AI and portfolio advisory by focusing on a specific user base, being college students.

Often with much less liquid capital, experience, and background knowledge than their more senior counterparts, college-age investors might need extra support getting their portfolio off the ground. This is where CollegiateCapital comes in; throughout this project, we will be prompting our model to treat users as students rather than clients, looking to offer practical and dynamic advice to empower their decisions. Enjoy!
